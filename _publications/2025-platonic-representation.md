We demonstrate that independently developed machine learning interatomic potentials exhibit consistent geometric organization of atomic environments. We unified the latent spaces of seven different models into a shared metric space using atomic anchors as reference points. This "Platonic representation" preserves chemical periodicity and structural properties, enabling cross-model comparison, interpretable embedding operations, and bias detection.
